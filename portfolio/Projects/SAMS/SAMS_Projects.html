                    This was our first project for the course and an introduction to Web Design with HTML and CSS. 
                    Our goal was to recreate a fake resume that was on Andrew Carnegie. I mainly used CSS to style 
                    the webpage.

                <p>
                    Another one of our projects was SAMS-tagarm where we created differnt boxes that looked like they
                    were a post from a social media site. The most difficult aspect of this assignment was creating
                    a blank div that had no elemetns within but still displayed on the page.
                </p>
                <!--Image displayed-->
                <div class="image_container">
                    <img class="SAMS_Projects_image" id="SAMS" src="SAMS-tagram1.0.png" /><br />
                    <a href="#">Link to Webpage </a>
                </div>

                <h1>SAMS-tagram 2.0</h1>
                <!--Information about the Project-->
                <p>
                    We later improved on the on SAMS-tagram 1.0 by adding the ability for you to add and delete different
                    post using JAVAscript. You could add different images by inserting an img url and typing a caption
                    that would be placed beneath the inserted image. If the caption overflowed the Post, the text would
                    wrap inside the div and you could scroll down to see more of the text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also linked Profile page to the home page where it
                    displayed information about Andrew Carnegie. Below the original text was a form where you could input
                    new information that would replace the original one. However, whenever you reloaded the page the
                    inputed infromation was not saved. Another issue was that when you did not input any information into
                    the form it set the bio information to blank.

                <p>
                    Moodboard was an assignment based majorily on Javascript. Whenever you input an image url it would
                    display it on the screen. When you got to the edge of the page it would wrap around and start a new
                    line with the images.

                    This was our first basic game using JAVAscript, HTML and a little CSS. Within the JAVAscript file
                    you had an array with a list of 20 words. Every 3 seconds a random word would be selected and
                    displayed on the page at a random location. At the top of the page you had a form where you could
                    type the words that were displayed on the page. By using an if staemtnt we where able to cross
                    refernce wether the typed value matched any of the values diplayed on the page and if it was true
                    the word was removed. The objective of the game was to constantly keep the page clear of any words.

                    For this assingment we used JAVAScript to create a form and CSS to make it look like a Post-it note.
                    I then added the ability to type text into the Post-it note and when you clicked enter it would diplay
                    the Post-it note with the writtten text in rows below the form. You could add multiple Post-it notes
                    and when you clicked on a Post-it note it would delete it.
